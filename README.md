# React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS Template

This is a template for creating React applications using Vite as the build tool, TypeScript for type-checking, and TailwindCSS for styling. I've developed this template primarily for my own use, but it's available for anyone looking for a solid starting point for their React projects.

Please note that this template comes with an opinionated ESLint configuration to ensure code consistency and quality. However, you are free to customize it according to your preferences and project requirements.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready app.

## Hosting

I recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting your React + Vite applications. It's easy to set up and provides a seamless deployment experience. You can deploy your app to Vercel by following these steps:

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Navigate to your project folder: `cd <your-repository-name>`
3. Run `vercel login` to log in to your Vercel account.
4. Run `vercel` and follow the prompts to deploy your app.

or go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/vite) and import your project.
